# Proof search: the implementation plan

The steps that take linlog from "parse, print, serialize" to a proof-search
suite: the algorithms of `proof-search-specifications.md` (the spec) for every
propositional fragment, automatic fragment detection with manual override,
intuitionistic and affine modes, proofs kept in a checkable format, exported
as LaTeX and Typst trees and as Rocq certificates, and a CLI that a human
understands. `linlog-web` is out of scope for now.

Each step is one Claude Code session started from one prompt file in this
directory. After each step the plan is reviewed and the later prompts are
amended (see "Review protocol"). `notes/` holds research the prompts rely on.
`reports/` is written by the sessions, one report per step.

## The steps

| # | Step | Prompt | Model | Effort | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Core refactor: fragments, modes, occurrence forest | `01-core-refactor.md` | Fable 5.1 | xhigh | – |
| 2 | Proof terms, the checker, derivations, serialization | `02-proofs.md` | Fable 5.1 | xhigh | 1 |
| 3 | The focused engine for MLL, MLL+units and MALL | `03-focused-engine.md` | Fable 5.1 | xhigh | 2 |
| 4 | Library API and CLI: `prove`, detection, overrides, output | `04-api-and-cli.md` | Opus 5.5 | high | 3 |
| 5 | Proof nets as a representation: structures, correctness, both conversions | `05-proof-nets.md` | Fable 5.1 | xhigh | 4 |
| 6 | Proof-net search for MLL | `06-net-search.md` | Fable 5.1 | xhigh | 5 |
| 7 | Exponentials: MELL and LL, affine mode | `07-exponentials.md` | Fable 5.1 | xhigh | 4 |
| 8 | Intuitionistic mode: ILL fragments, additive fast path | `08-intuitionistic.md` | Fable 5.1 | xhigh | 6, 7 |
| 9 | LaTeX and Typst export of sequents and derivations | `09-latex-typst.md` | Opus 5.5 | high | 8 |
| 10 | SVG export of sequents, derivations and proof nets | `10-svg.md` | Opus 5.5 | high | 8 |
| 11 | Rocq certificates | `11-certificates.md` | Fable 5.1 | high | 9 |
| 12 | Parallel search | `12-parallel.md` | Fable 5.1 | xhigh | 8 |
| 13 | Benchmarks, LLTP input, hard families | `13-benchmarks.md` | Opus 5.5 | high | 12 |
| 14 | Later: MELL nets with boxes, essential nets, inverse method, Petri nets, Lambek, MALL nets | `14-later.md` | – | – | 13 |

Steps 5–6 and 7 are independent of each other; 9, 10 and 12 are independent
of each other. Everything else is in order.

### Why these models and efforts

Checked against the model docs on 2026-09-29
(platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview and
…/choosing-a-model). The current lineup: Claude Fable 5.1 (`claude-fable-5-1`,
$10/$50 per MTok, "for demanding reasoning and long-horizon agentic work",
default effort `high`), Claude Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`, $4/$20, "for
long-running agentic coding", recommended starting point for most workloads,
default effort `medium`), Claude Sonnet 5.5 (`claude-sonnet-5-5`, $2/$10) and
Haiku 4.5. Effort levels are `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`; the docs
say `xhigh` is the best setting for most coding and agentic work, and to move
from Opus 5.5 to Fable 5.1 when a task's demands on reasoning or horizon exceed
what Opus at `xhigh`/`max` delivers.

- **Fable 5.1 at `xhigh`** for every step whose correctness is subtle and
  whose mistakes propagate: the data model (1), the checker that anchors
  soundness (2), proof nets and their criterion (5), each search engine
  (3, 6, 7, 8) and the parallel runtime (12). `max` is the knob to turn if a
  step's review finds reasoning gaps; it was not chosen up front because it
  costs more on every turn.
- **Fable 5.1 at `high`** for the certificate step (11): a long,
  research-heavy session (Rocq, NanoYalla, nix) rather than a deep
  algorithmic one.
- **Opus 5.5 at `high`** for plumbing and user-facing work (4, 9, 10, 13):
  clap, output formats, emitters, SVG layout and a benchmark harness. Set
  explicitly, since Opus 5.5 defaults to `medium`. Sonnet 5.5 at `xhigh` is
  the cheaper alternative for 9, 10 and 13 if cost matters more than a
  first-pass finish.

### The commands (nushell)

Run from the repository root, one at a time, in order. `open --raw` passes the
prompt file as one string; `--name` labels the session in `claude --resume`.

The aliases `fable` and `opus` also work for `--model`. The flags are
documented at code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference.

## Review protocol

1. A step's session commits its work thematically with jj and ends by writing
   `plan/reports/NN-<name>.md` (what was done, decisions, deviations from the
   spec or this plan, open questions, what later steps must know). It does
   not push and does not edit the other prompt files.
2. The planning session (the one that wrote this file; `claude --resume` and
   pick it, or start any session with "review step NN of plan/README.md")
   reads the report and the changes (`jj log`, `jj diff -r`), runs the checks,
   judges whether the result fits the plan, and amends the later prompts and
   the decisions below. It records the outcome in "Status" and commits the plan
   changes as "Plan: review step NN".
3. Only then the next command is run.

## Design decisions

These bind every step. A step that finds one of them wrong says so in its
report and, if the fix is local, makes it; otherwise it stops and asks.

**D1. One formula representation.** Formulas stay in the hash-consed arena
of `Sequent` (`core/src/sequents/`), in negation normal form, one-sided:
two-sided input `Γ ⊢ Δ` is lowered to `⊢ Γ^⊥, Δ`. Intuitionistic sequents
need no second data model: an ILL formula in NNF has a *polarized shape*
(output position: `⊗ ⊕ & ! 1 ⊤ 0`, atoms `Var`, and `A^⊥ ⅋ B` for `A ⊸ B`;
input position: the duals, `DualVar` atoms, `⊥ ⊤ 0`, and `A ⊗ B^⊥` for a
hypothesis `A ⊸ B`), which is read back losslessly. An ILL sequent is a
one-sided sequent with exactly one output-shaped root and only input-shaped
others. This is Lamarche's polarization and what the spec's two-sided engine
computes its counts on. Two-sided printing and export recover `⊸` from it.

**D2. Fragments and modes are runtime values.** Automatic detection needs a
value, not a type. `Fragment` records which connective classes an input uses
(multiplicatives, their units, additives, their units, exponentials) and
`Mode` records what the user asked for: classical or intuitionistic, linear
or affine, with or without Mix. The `Logic` type parameter, the marker types
`LL`/`MLL` and the `subenum` dependency go away; fragment-typed sequents have
no consumer once engines run on occurrence forests.

**D3. One index type.** Arena and occurrence indices are `u32`. The `Index`
trait and the type parameter `I` on `Sequent` are removed: their flexibility
has no user, they make every signature and every `impl` harder to read, and
the spec's engines use `u32` throughout. Newtypes (`TermId`, `OccId`, `Atom`)
keep the indices apart at the type level.

**D4. Module layout inside the `linlog` crate**, not eight crates as the
spec proposes: the workspace stays `core/` and `cli/` (a `bench/` crate may
come in step 11). Suggested modules, adjusted by the steps as they see fit:
`sequents` (arena, printing), `parse`, `serialize`, `fragment` (D2 and
detection), `occurrences` (the forest of D5), `proofs` (terms, checker,
derivations, rendering), `nets` (proof structures, the criterion, the two
conversions), `search` (`prove`, options, outcome, dispatch, and one
submodule per engine: `focus`, `net`, `additive`), `export` (`latex`,
`typst`, `svg`, `rocq`). `core/src/linear/` (empty placeholders) is
replaced.

**D5. Occurrence forest per problem.** Every engine works on the spec's
occurrence forest (section "Common infrastructure"): subformula occurrences
numbered in DFS preorder so a subtree is a contiguous range, with per
occurrence kind, parent, children, size, polarity, atom and sign, plus per
atom the lists of positive and negative literal occurrences. Sequents inside
a search are sets (bitsets) or count vectors over occurrence ids. The forest
is built deterministically from a `Sequent` (root order = `term_ids` order),
so occurrence ids are stable across runs and serializations.

**D6. Proofs are terms over occurrence ids, checked independently.** The
canonical proof is the spec's term (`Ax`, `Tensor`, `Par`, `With`, `Plus`,
`One`, `Bot`, `Top`, `Bang`, `Quest`, `Copy`, plus what weakening, Mix and
the intuitionistic rules need), stored compactly. A checker that shares no
code with any engine re-derives the sequent of every node and rejects
anything else; every engine's output passes it in tests. From a term and its
forest a `Derivation` view is produced: the tree of explicit sequents and
rule names of the standard (unfocused, non-dyadic) sequent calculus, one-sided
for classical and two-sided for intuitionistic mode, with structural rules
explicit. Rendering, LaTeX, Typst and Rocq export consume the view.

**D6a. Proof nets are a second first-class representation.** A `ProofNet`
is a proof structure over the occurrence forest (the formula trees plus
axiom links, and Mix where enabled), with a correctness checker that is
independent of any search engine (the Danos–Regnier criterion, implemented
through the Yeo-theorem test the spec describes, with the connectedness
equation unless Mix is on), sequentialization (net → derivation, by the
splitting-tensor lemma) and desequentialization (derivation → net, by
reading the axiom links off the term). The checker's verdict together with a
successful sequentialization is the net's correctness certificate: the
resulting term passes the proof checker of D6. Nets exist for MLL with or
without Mix, where they are canonical; MELL nets with boxes come later
(step 14) and MALL nets are out of scope (non-canonical, exponentially
large). Search engines use whichever representation suits them; the
conversions make every proof available in both.

**D7. One engine per algorithm, not per fragment.** The spec's MLL-Seq,
MALL-Seq, MELL-Seq and the LL engine are one focused engine with rule sets
switched on by fragment and mode (`search::focus`). The two-sided
intuitionistic engine is the same skeleton with a goal side (step 7 decides
whether it is a parameter or a sibling module). Proof-net search is
`search::net`. The additive-only fast path is `search::additive`.

**D8. Dispatch table** (auto-detection picks the row; `--engine` forces one,
`--fragment` asserts one):

| Mode | Detected fragment | Engine |
|---|---|---|
| classical | additives only, two roots | additive (step 8) |
| classical | MLL without units, with or without Mix | net search (step 6) |
| classical | MLL with units, MALL | focus (step 3) |
| classical | MELL, LL | focus with exponentials and copy bound (step 7) |
| affine | anything | focus with weakening and the supermultiset prune (step 7) |
| intuitionistic | IMLL over `⊗ ⊸ 1` | embedding into net search (step 8), essential nets later (step 14) |
| intuitionistic | IMALL, IMELL, ILL, affine variants | two-sided focus (step 8) |

**D9. Outcomes are three-valued.** `Proved(proof)`, `Unprovable` (only when
the search was exhaustive) and `Unknown` (bound or time limit hit, with the
reason). Search takes options (copy bound, time limit, memo cap, thread
count, determinism) and returns statistics (nodes, memo size, time).

**D10. Dependencies.** Adopt through the `new-tool` skill, scoped to the
crate and feature that uses them. Candidates checked on 2026-09-29 (all
licenses allowed by `deny.toml`; see `notes/export-targets.md` § Crates):
`fixedbitset` (bitsets), `foldhash` or `rustc-hash` (hashing; `ahash` needs
`getrandom` care on wasm), `smallvec`, `ena` (union-find with snapshots and
rollback), `rayon` and `dashmap` behind a `parallel` feature (off on wasm),
`postcard` if a binary serialization format is wanted next to JSON. No
`unsafe`.

**D11. Wasm stays possible.** Nothing in `core` may need threads or the OS
unconditionally: parallelism and timing live behind features or in the CLI.

**D12. Graphics are generated, not laid out by a general graph tool.** SVG
comes from deterministic layouts that the objects themselves suggest: a
derivation is a tree laid out bottom-up by subtree width (as ebproof does),
a proof net is its formula trees drawn downwards from the conclusions with
the axiom links as arcs above the literals, a sequent is a line of text.
Fonts are declared, not measured: a monospace font with a fixed advance per
character makes the layout exact without font metrics. No graphviz, no
browser-side layout. The same layouts feed the LaTeX and Typst exports where
a package needs coordinates (it does not for ebproof and curryst trees).

## Status
