# Step 15 and beyond: later work

Sketches, not prompts. Each becomes a prompt in the style of the others
when its turn comes, after the reviews of steps 1 to 14 have settled the
APIs. The order is a suggestion.

## 15a. MELL proof nets with exponential boxes

Extend `nets` (step 5) with `!`-boxes and the `?` nodes (dereliction,
contraction, weakening as net nodes; or the "generalized ?" node with
auxiliary doors), correctness as the Danos–Regnier criterion applied at
each box depth with boxes contracted to single nodes (Guerrini–Masini 2001
for the parsing view), sequentialization through boxes, and the SVG drawing
with boxes as rectangles. Search stays with the focused engine; the value
is the representation (display, conversion, correctness). Fable 5.1, xhigh.

## 15b. Essential nets for IMLL

The spec's IMLL-Net: Lamarche's polarized structures using the D1
polarization from step 8, correctness by directed acyclicity plus the
dominator condition (Murawski–Ong), incremental search with a transitive
closure bit-matrix and an undo log (Moot 2008). Compare against the
embedding route of step 8 on the benchmarks of step 14 before making it the
default for IMLL. Fable 5.1, xhigh.

## 15c. The focused inverse method

The spec's second engine for MALL and the semi-decision alternative for
MELL/ILL when Θ is large: forward saturation from initial sequents in the
subformula closure with subsumption indexing (feature vectors as in Schulz
2013). A new `search::inverse` engine with its own dispatch row driven by a
heuristic (many hypotheses, small goal) or `--engine inverse`. Fable 5.1,
xhigh.

## 15d. The !-Horn fragment through Petri-net reachability

Detect the fragment, build the net, and either call an external reachability
tool (KReach) through the CLI or implement coverability for the affine case.
Only worth it with the ILLTP Petri-net problems from step 14 as the
benchmark. Opus 5.5, high.

## 15e. Cyclic MLL and the Lambek calculus

A non-commutative mode: planar axiom linkings in the net engine (links may
not cross in the cyclic order of literals), no exchange in the derivation
view and exports, and the Lambek restrictions (no empty antecedent, the two
divisions). Fable 5.1, xhigh.

## 15f. MALL proof nets

Only if a use case appears: Hughes–van Glabbeek nets or conflict nets are
non-canonical or exponentially large, so they are a display feature, not a
search vehicle. Assess first.

## 15g. The web front end

`linlog-web`: the `core` crate compiled to wasm without the `parallel`
feature (and without whichever optional features of D14 the client does not
ship), the interactive state of step 9 as the client's state with its JSON
as the wire form, the SVG of partial derivations from step 11 as the
picture, and the JSON formats for import and export. Its own plan.
