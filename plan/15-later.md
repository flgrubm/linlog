# Step 15 and beyond: later work

Sketches, not prompts. Each becomes a prompt in the style of the others
when its turn comes, after the reviews of steps 1 to 14 have settled the
APIs. The order is a suggestion.

## 15a. MELL proof nets with exponential boxes

Extend `nets` (step 5) with `!`-boxes and the `?` nodes (dereliction,
contraction, weakening as net nodes; or the "generalized ?" node with
auxiliary doors), correctness as the Danos–Regnier criterion applied at
each box depth with boxes contracted to single nodes (Guerrini–Masini 2001
for the parsing view), sequentialization through boxes, and the SVG drawing
with boxes as rectangles. Search stays with the focused engine; the value
is the representation (display, conversion, correctness). Fable 5.1, xhigh.

## 15b. Essential nets for IMLL

The spec's IMLL-Net: Lamarche's polarized structures using the D1
polarization from step 8, correctness by directed acyclicity plus the
dominator condition (Murawski–Ong), incremental search with a transitive
closure bit-matrix and an undo log (Moot 2008). Compare against the
embedding route of step 8 on the benchmarks of step 14 before making it the
default for IMLL: step 8 showed the verdict needs no essential-net
condition (every sequentialization of a classical net of an IMLL sequent
is intuitionistic), so this is a performance alternative, and its report
sketches the engine as the dominator condition added to the net engine's
`complete` branch. Fable 5.1, xhigh.

## 15a'. Focused-engine follow-ups from the exponentials

For the performance pass (14b), with step 14's numbers: a canonical choice
among identical members of a stable sequent (hypotheses that are the same
formula are distinct occurrences today, so the memo sees `C(n, k)` sequents
where there is one up to renaming), a nested forced rule for a `⊗` factor
that is itself a tensor of positive literals, a per-level restart from the
frontier of exhausted sequents rather than re-exploring the levels below,
and a hash per branch-stack entry for the loop check. Separately, whether
a sound and useful affine prune exists (Kopylov's decidability argument
does not give one directly; the spec's was unsound) is a research question
to keep open; until then affine mode stays bounded.

## 15a''. Intuitionistic follow-ups

Left open by step 8, none of them a correctness issue. The written
succedent: for formulas built from `⊤` and `0` alone the reading's goal is
the last root by id, not the written one (`0, ⊤ ⊢ ⊤` prints as `0, 0 ⊢ 0`;
provability never differs, 607 464 cases brute-forced), and recovering it
means the arena keeps the parser's root order or the count of right-hand
roots, a change to `Sequent`'s canonical form and JSON; do it only if a
user of the two-sided print or the certificates asks. The additive path on
more than two roots, and on a `!` of an additive formula, is decided by
the focused engine today. The identical-hypotheses follow-up of 15a'
applies two-sided as well.

## 15b'. Net-engine pruning for repeated literals

Part of the performance pass (14b) if step 14's numbers ask for it: leaf
symmetry breaking for pure `⊗` and `⅋` trees of equal literals, a per-atom
balance over the `⊗`-skeleton components of a partial structure (the net
engine's analogue of the focused engine's split counts), and the sound
variant of symmetry breaking for equal compound conclusions (keys under
roots no symmetry moves; the spec's first-literal key is unsound across
groups, as step 6's report shows). Fable 5.1, xhigh.

## 15c. The focused inverse method

The spec's second engine for MALL and the semi-decision alternative for
MELL/ILL when Θ is large: forward saturation from initial sequents in the
subformula closure with subsumption indexing (feature vectors as in Schulz
2013). A new `search::inverse` engine with its own dispatch row driven by a
heuristic (many hypotheses, small goal) or `--engine inverse`. Fable 5.1,
xhigh.

## 15d. The !-Horn fragment through Petri-net reachability

Detect the fragment, build the net, and either call an external reachability
tool (KReach) through the CLI or implement coverability for the affine case.
Only worth it with the ILLTP Petri-net problems from step 14 as the
benchmark. Opus 5.5, high.

## 15e. Cyclic MLL and the Lambek calculus

A non-commutative mode: planar axiom linkings in the net engine (links may
not cross in the cyclic order of literals), no exchange in the derivation
view and exports, and the Lambek restrictions (no empty antecedent, the two
divisions). Fable 5.1, xhigh.

## 15f. MALL proof nets

Only if a use case appears: Hughes–van Glabbeek nets or conflict nets are
non-canonical or exponentially large, so they are a display feature, not a
search vehicle. Assess first.

## 15g. The web front end

`linlog-web`: the `core` crate compiled to wasm without the `parallel`
feature (and without whichever optional features of D14 the client does not
ship), the interactive state of step 9 as the client's state with its JSON
as the wire form, the SVG of partial derivations from step 11 as the
picture, and the JSON formats for import and export. Its own plan, which
starts from `plan/reports/09-interactive.md`, "For steps 10 to 12 and the
web front end": the calls the client makes (`Interactive::new` or the JSON,
`goals`/`goal`/`reading` to draw the goals with positions as click
targets, `rules` for the menu, `split_passes` to grey out a split,
`apply`, `undo`, `close` with a node-counting stop closure since wasm has
no clock in core, `derivation` for the picture, `proof` at the end), and
the `linlog interact` command of step 9 as the reference behaviour.

## 15g'. Interactive follow-ups

Left open by step 9, none a correctness issue. The net engine works on a
proof structure over the whole forest, so an MLL goal off the roots goes
to the focused engine and `Engine::Net` forced on it is `Error::NetGoal`;
a structure over a sub-forest (the goal's subtrees as conclusions) would
let the net engine close such goals, worth it only if the front end's
profiles show `close` on wide MLL goals. The intuitionistic reading is
recomputed per operation (O(n) in the forest), since `Reading` borrows the
forest the state owns; positions stored in the state fix that if a client
with thousands of occurrences asks. `rules` lists by connective and mode
only, and `apply` says what the context lacks; a fully filtered list means
trying each rule on a clone. A Mix that sends every formula to one side
opens an empty goal that nothing closes (nullary Mix is not a rule);
refusing that split is a one-line policy decision. `close_all` runs the
goals in order under one stop closure; a per-goal budget is the client's
wrapping. Reading a state back requires the two-sided rule names that the
library writes, while `apply` also accepts the classical name in
intuitionistic mode; harmless for the library's own JSON.
